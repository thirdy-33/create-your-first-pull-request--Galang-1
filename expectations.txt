My expectations for this class for this semester is that I would learn and know the idea of web programming more further than I had before taking this course.
I would also be trying to apply this course in the future as web development/programming is a key part in programming that has it's versatility and usefullness.
My main personal goal for this course is that I would be able to finish a project or program that would involve not only me but also a group so that I would
be able to practice teaming up whenever I need to do so.

Overall, I would think I would enjoy and learn a lot in this course and that I would like to also share this knowledge in the future if I can.
